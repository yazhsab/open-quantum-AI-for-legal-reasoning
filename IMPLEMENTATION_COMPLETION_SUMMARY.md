manager = GSTDisputeManager()
case = GSTDisputeCase(...)  # Create case with details
analysis = manager.analyze_gst_dispute(case)
print(f"Success Probability: {analysis.success_probability}")
```

### Legal Aid Assessment
```python
from src.xqelm.use_cases.legal_aid import LegalAidManager, LegalAidCase

manager = LegalAidManager()
case = LegalAidCase(...)  # Create case with applicant details
assessment = manager.assess_legal_aid_eligibility(case)
print(f"Eligibility Score: {assessment.eligibility_score}")
